    "To solve gas-in-liquid absorption problems, we need information about the solubility of the chosen gas in the solvent used. Normally, this information is determined experimentally. If such information is not available, Henry's law can be used, although it has limitations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Henry's law relates the solubility of a gas in a liquid as a function of the partial pressure of that gas in contact with the liquid. It is valid for dilute solutions, when there is no reaction between solute (gas) and solvent (liquid) and strictly under equilibrium conditions, i.e. when both phases have been in contact for the time necessary for pressures and concentrations to reach the stationary value. There are several ways of expressing Henry's law. In this presentation, we will adopt the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "x_i =H_i p_i\n",
    "\\label{eq:Henry}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x_i$ is the concentration of the solute gas in the liquid (given by the mole fraction), $p_i$ is the partial pressure of gas $i$ that is in contact with the liquid and $H_i$ is Henry's constant, which depends on the nature of the solute gas, the solvent liquid and the temperature. In the equation \\eqref{eq:Henry}, if the partial pressure is given in atmospheres, then the units of Henry's constant are given in $\\mathrm{atm}^{-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Henry's law expresses the proportionality between the partial pressure of the gas and its solubility in a given solvent. Therefore, if the partial pressure of the gas is doubled, its concentration in the solution will also double. This relationship is shown qualitatively in the figure below. \n",
