    "The **liquid-liquid extraction** is a separation operation via mass transfer in which a chemical species (solute **C**) passes from a liquid phase **A** to another liquid phase **B**. For the operation to be profitable the following conditions should be met:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Liquid **B** must have a higher affinity for solute **C** than liquid **A** has.\n",
    "- Liquids **A** and **B** must be immiscible or partially miscible.\n",

    "In this unit we will review some basic concepts about the representation of mixtures in ternary diagrams, which we will use to solve liquid-liquid extraction problems that frequently appear in Chemical Engineering.\n",

    "The extraction processes involve three substances: the liquid **A**, from which we want to extract the solute **C**, and the liquid **B** which we use as solvent. The composition of the system is completely determined by two of the three mole or mass fractions of the substances, since at all times the following must be true:\n",

    "The same relation is true if we work with mass fractions ($w_A + w_B + w_C = 1$). If the composition of the system is given in %, then the relation becomes $x_A + x_B + x_C = 100$. Therefore, since we only need 2 of the 3 compositions, the composition of a three-component system can be determined using a 2D plane (unlike binary mixtures, where the composition can be determined entirely using a 1D line, since knowing the mole fraction of one of the two substances is sufficient).\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using a plane with typical Cartesian axes, it is common to use **triangular or ternary plots** to represent mixtures of three compounds. In this diagram the lines of the axes form an angle of 60° (instead of the 90° they form in a diagram with Cartesian axes) and the complete diagram consists of an equilateral triangle.\n",

Specifically, to read the composition of compound **A**, we will have to draw a line parallel to the opposite side of the vertex representing compound **A**.\n",
    "\n",

Note how the point is represented in the diagram and how the compositions are read. Note also how, although the position of the point on the diagram does not change when the direction of the axes is changed, the way in which the compositions are read on the axes does change. For clarity, the labels of compounds **A**, **B** and **C** are shown both on the vertices and on the sides indicating their respective composition.
